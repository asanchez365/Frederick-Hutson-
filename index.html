<h1>Biography:</h1>

<h2>Frederick Hutson grew up in Brooklyn, NY with a single mother and three siblings. At a young age he moved to St. Petersburg, Florida, where he attended Brandon High School. At 23, he was sent to federal prison for the illegal distribution of 3,000 kg of marijuana. While serving his time in prison, Frederick noticed that many inmates have a difficult time communicating with their family and friends. Therefore, once Frederick served his time and got out of prison, he founded a company that helps inmates communicate with their family and friends through a postal service. Under Frederickâ€™s leadership, Pigeonly has become one of the largest independent inmate services providers in the country.</h2>
